\begin{abstract}
    Phytoplankton population dynamics are an important topic of the current research worldwide. This group of microorganisms constitutes a fundamental resource, producing at least half of the oxygen in the atmosphere; moreover, in some cases the overgrowth of some species can be harmful to animals and even humans.
    It is thus important to understand the mechanisms which regulate its growth. This thesis focuses on the role of fluid dynamics in the formation of ``blooms'' of phytoplankton in eutrophic conditions, where the growth is limited by light availability. Implementing the reaction dynamics of the phytoplankton, a one-dimensional stochastic model is developed to explore different conditions. A simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations is then used to describe in more detail the dynamics of bloom formation.
