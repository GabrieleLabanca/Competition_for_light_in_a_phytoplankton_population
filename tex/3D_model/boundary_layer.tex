\subsection{Measures}
In \textit{no-slip} case, the velocity at the boundary layer is a null vector, then all its derivatives parallel to the layer are zero: \( \nabla_\parallel u_i = 0 \) and in particular 
\[ \partial_x u_x = \partial_y u_y =0 \]
so that the incompressibility condition \(\partial_i u_i = 0\) implies 
\[ \partial_z u_z = 0 \]
This means that the first term in the Taylor expansion of $u_i$ as a function of $z$ will be the one proportional to the second derivative, thus to $z^2$, meaning that it is expected that
\[ |u_z|^2 \propto z^4 \]
The \textit{free-slip} conditions however do not imply such assumptions on the derivatives, so that the Taylor's term containing the first derivative is not zero and 
\[ |u_z|^2 \propto z^2 \]
