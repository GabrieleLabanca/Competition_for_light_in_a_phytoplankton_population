The pseudo-spectral code described in \autoref{sec:pseudospectral} is by Filippo De Lillo, Guido Boffetta, Matteo Borgnino \textit{et al.} from Universit√† degli Studi di Torino. \\
Gnuplot (\url{http://gnuplot.info/}) is the tool used to plot and fit data. Some of the palettes used for the plots are from \url{https://github.com/Gnuplotting/gnuplot-palettes}. I wish to thank the site \url{http://www.gnuplotting.org} for the reference. \\
This work would have been much harder without the help by the site \url{stackoverflow.com}, my gratitude to the online coding community. \\
I wish to thank my supervisors and the other people from the research team, for their support and kindness.\\
I express my gratitude to all my friends and above all to my family, I would not be here without them.\\
Finally, if the reader does not belong to any of the groups above, thanks to him for having got to the end.
